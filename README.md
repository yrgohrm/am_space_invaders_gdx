# Space invaders demo project

This is a very basic space invaders demo for use in one of my classes to show some basic GDX code.

This is not a good example of how to make a game, it is just there to give some hints as to what one could do to create a very basic game.

## Building and running

To build the project run `./gradlew build`.

To run the program run `./gradlew run`.

This should invoke the gradle wrapper and install Gradle on your system. To manually install Gradle on your system, download and install the latest version from [gradle.org](https://gradle.org/).
